-- Write a query that separates the `location` field into separate fields for latitude and longitude. You can compare your results against the actual `lat` and `lon` fields in the table.
SELECT location,
       TRIM(leading '(' FROM LEFT(location, POSITION(',' IN location) - 1)) AS lattitude,
       TRIM(trailing ')' FROM RIGHT(location, LENGTH(location) - POSITION(',' IN location) ) ) AS longitude
