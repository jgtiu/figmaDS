-- Write a query that shows only the duration of the trip and the percentile into which that duration falls (across the entire datasetâ€”not partitioned by terminal).
SELECT duration_seconds,
       NTILE(100) OVER (ORDER BY duration_seconds)
         AS percentile
  FROM tutorial.dc_bikeshare_q1_2012
 WHERE start_time < '2012-01-08'
 ORDER BY 1 DESC
