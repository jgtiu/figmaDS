-- Write a query that shows a running total of the duration of bike rides (similar to the last example), but grouped by end_terminal, and with ride duration sorted in descending order.

SELECT end_terminal,
       duration_seconds,
       SUM(duration_seconds) OVER
         (PARTITION BY end_terminal ORDER BY duration_seconds DESC)
         AS running_total
  FROM tutorial.dc_bikeshare_q1_2012
 WHERE start_time < '2012-01-08'
